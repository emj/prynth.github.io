![Close up](../images/close_up_1.jpg){: width="300px" .align-right} To get started creating your own synth you should read about the [Prynth framework](framework.html). After that you can explore the [documentation](/create/documentation/) and the [downloads](downloads.html) section for obtaining the necessary technical components.

This is a work-in-progress, so you might miss certain documentation or encounter various bugs. We ask you to file those through our [Github page](http://prynth.github.io/).
